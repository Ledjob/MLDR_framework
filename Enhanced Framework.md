//-----------------------------------------------------------//

All layers operate simultaneously but with different processing priorities.
Information flows both upward and downward through the system.
Cross-layer communication is continuous and bi-directional.
Resource allocation is dynamic based on task demands.
System maintains logs of all processing paths for analysis.
Error detection and correction occur at all levels.
Performance metrics are continuously gathered and analyzed.
System adapts parameters based on task success rates.
