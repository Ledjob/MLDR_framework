# **Framework for multi-layered, dynamic reasoning that combines parallel processing with hierarchical decision-making.**

TAG : [[MLDR]]

### **Core Idea**

Simulating a "higher-dimensional" thinking process, where each layer or module handles a specific type of task. By combining tree-like reasoning, randomness, and inference, you aim to simulate the way humans connect abstract thoughts to concrete outputs.

### **Proposed Architecture**

1. **Input Layer: Understanding the Task**
   - **Task Parsing:** Break down the user’s input into its simplest components.
   - **Context Setting:** What is already known? Retrieve related knowledge (e.g., definitions, histories, principles).
   - **Initial Queries:** Generate a set of _questions_ or _paths_ to explore further.

---

2. **First Thinking Layer: Base Layer (Tree Thinking + Randomness)**  
   This is like a brainstorming engine:
   - **Tree Structure:** Explore direct associations and adjacent knowledge (breadth-first thinking).
   - **Randomness:** Inject unexpected or creative prompts (e.g., “What if X didn't exist?” or “How would a child view this problem?”).
   - **Sub-Layers:** Use smaller, specialized models (different weights or domains) to evaluate specific paths in parallel.

---

3. **Second Thinking Layer: Analysis and Refinement**  
   After gathering responses from smaller models:
   - **Combine Results:** Look for overlapping or intersecting ideas.
   - **Prune Irrelevant Paths:** Focus on the most promising threads while keeping a record of discarded ones (for future reference or reanalysis).
   - **Deep Dive:** Use more advanced models for detailed reasoning on narrowed-down paths.

---

4. **Output Layer: Final Prompting and Validation**
   - **Synthesizing Results:** Turn all the analyzed paths into a cohesive response.
   - **Validation:** Cross-check outputs against known data or logic. Anything unverifiable is labeled as speculative or theoretical.
   - **Output:** Present results along with the reasoning and confidence level.

### **Dynamic Features**

- **Asynchronous Thinking:** Smaller models work independently on sub-problems, sending results back to the main model. This reduces bottlenecks and encourages exploration.
- **Horizontal and Vertical Thinking:**
  - Horizontal: Exploring many ideas simultaneously.
  - Vertical: Diving deeply into one specific idea to extract nuances.
- **Memory Integration:** Like the subconscious, previous thoughts and inferences remain "latent," ready to influence new paths when relevant.
